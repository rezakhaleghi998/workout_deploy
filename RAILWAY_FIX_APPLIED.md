# 🚂 Railway Deployment - Emergency Fix

## ⚡ Quick Fix Applied

Your app should now work! The issues were:

### 🔧 Fixed Issues:
1. **Missing PORT handling** - Added proper PORT configuration
2. **Wrong startup command** - Created `railway_start.sh` script  
3. **Missing domain** - Added `wellness.up.railway.app` to ALLOWED_HOSTS
4. **Simplified build process** - Removed unnecessary Node.js dependency

### 📝 What Was Changed:
- ✅ `railway.json` - Uses `railway_start.sh` startup script
- ✅ `railway_start.sh` - Complete startup sequence with migrations
- ✅ `settings.py` - Added PORT handling and Railway domain
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Simplified Python-only build
- ✅ `Procfile` - Fixed for Railway compatibility

## 🚀 Railway Should Auto-Redeploy

Railway automatically redeploys when you push to GitHub. Your app should be working at:
**https://wellness.up.railway.app**

## 🔍 If Still Not Working:

### 1. Check Railway Logs
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Click on your service
- Check "Deployments" tab for build logs

### 2. Environment Variables Needed
Make sure these are set in Railway:
```
DATABASE_URL (auto-set by PostgreSQL service)
SECRET_KEY (optional - has default)
```

### 3. Manual Restart
- In Railway dashboard, click "Restart"

### 4. Admin Access
Once working, access admin at:
**https://wellness.up.railway.app/admin/**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

## 🔧 Emergency Commands

If you need to manually create admin user:
```bash
# In Railway terminal
python manage.py shell
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
User.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'admin@example.com', 'admin123')
```

Your deployment should be working now! 🎉
